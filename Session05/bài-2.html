            >Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American
            singer-songwriter. Known for her autobiographical songwriting,
            artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading figure
            in popular music and the subject of widespread media coverage, with a
            vast fanbase known as Swifties. <br />
            Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country
            singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). The
            singles "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story", and "You Belong with
            Mo" found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She
            incorporated rock on Sponk Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012),
            later re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop
            set 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the
            hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard
            Hot 100 number one singles "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together""
            Shake It Off. "Blank Space". "Bad Blood" and "Look What You Made Me
            Do".</i
